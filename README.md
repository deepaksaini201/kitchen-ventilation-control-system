# Kitchen Ventilation Control System
## An Automation &amp; IoT solution for Smart Kitchen Ventilation Control
KVCS is a solution to control Centralized Exhaust Systems in Old apartments, common in Denmark. It provides a way to control the airflow by closing the airflow via blocking the pipe using a Motorized Damper, through a relay, and a sensor. It significantly reduces the noise in the apartment, creating a more comfortable environment.

## Story
Do you ever think, "There must be a smarter way to do this?" ðŸ¤” That's how I started my newest project, the Kitchen Ventilation Control System (KVCS)!  
  
I'm happy to share how I used Automation and IoT to build a smart system for the kitchen exhaust system. As my apartment building is old and the exhaust is centralised, I couldnâ€™t turn it off. It was very annoying to have this constant noise, bothering you all the time.  
  
I designed this system myself. It uses a motorized air damper, smart devices like a Smart Relay (for exact control), and a Door/Window Sensor (for automatic actions). Now, kitchen ventilation can open and close exactly when needed, all by itself, and the constant hiss is gone forever!  
  
This project is more than just tech. It helps make homes more comfortable (my wife and I can finally whisper instead of talking loudly) and works without you having to touch anything.  
  
I'm very proud that I made this project from start to finish. I wrote down every step: I made a Purchase list, a clear electrical drawing, and an easy-to-follow manual. This means others can understand and even build it too! (For educational purposes)
