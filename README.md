## An Automation &amp; IoT solution for Smart Kitchen Ventilation Control.
KVCS is a solution to control Centralized Exhaust Systems in Old apartments, common in Denmark. It provides a way to control the airflow by closing the airflow via blocking the pipe using a Motorized Damper, through a relay, and a sensor. It significantly reduces the noise in the apartment, creating a more comfortable environment.
